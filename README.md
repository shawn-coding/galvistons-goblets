An ASP.NET Core application that works with a Microsoft SQL Server to display CRUD operations for a fictional business.

## What actually is this?
A .NET core app that I, shawn-coding, found online. It is a tutorial on YouTube provided by the channel BoostMyTool on May 13, 2022. I followed along to get the basic
workflow and created this repo from my work.

## Why was this made?
This was a chance to practice working on .NET projects for boosting my portfolio, as well as seeing how I could work with databases and sensitive credentials.

## What is in here that isn't in the video?
I substituted the plain text of connection strings with some user secret configurations to hide it from outside influence. I also created a separate models folder
and had the controllers import the reference to reinforce MVC methodology and make the project structure a bit more readable.
